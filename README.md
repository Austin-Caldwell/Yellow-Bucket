# Yellow Bucket Database and C# Application

Note: The project was originally known as "CSC 365 Yellow Bucket Database Design Project"

Yellow Bucket is a C# Windows Forms application which interacts with a SQL database (originally on Microsoft SQL Server 2014) and allows users to rent, return, and rate movies stored in the database.  This project originated as a college class project, so it does not have an actual (commercial) implementation.

In 2015, Austin Caldwell, Evan Wehr, and Jacob Girvin started work on the Yellow-Bucket-CSC365 Database Design Project for the CSC 365 - Databases class at Geneva College.  Since then, edits have been made to continue to continue the project and fix bugs in the code.
