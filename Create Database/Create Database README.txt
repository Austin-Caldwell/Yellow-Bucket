Run SQL commands in this folder to create the database.

Run the 'Create Database and Tables' SQL command to generate the entire database, with tables created in order based on foreign key dependencies.
NOTE: 'Create Database' and 'Create Database and Tables' will delete any previously existing YellowBucketCSC365 database before creating a new one.
