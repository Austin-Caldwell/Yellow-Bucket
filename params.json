  "body": "### Project Description\r\nYellow Bucket is a C# Windows Forms application which interacts with a SQL database (originally on Microsoft SQL Server 2014) and allows users to rent, return, and rate movies stored in the database.  This project originated as a college class project, so it does not have an actual (commercial) implementation.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2015, Austin Caldwell (@Austin-Caldwell), Evan Wehr (@ENWehr), and Jacob Girvin (@Girv53) started work on the \"Yellow-Bucket-CSC365 Database Design Project\" for the CSC 365 (Databases) class at Geneva College.  Since then, the project has been renamed to \"Yellow Bucket,\" additions have been made to the code to continue to continue the project, and bugs in the C#/SQL code have been fixed.",
